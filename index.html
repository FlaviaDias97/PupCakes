      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Welcome to PupCakes, where our passion for baking meets our love for
        dogs. Our story began with a simple idea: to create cupcakes that not
        only taste amazing but also celebrate our furry friends. Inspired by the
        unique characteristics of different dog breeds, each PupCake is crafted
        with care, using the finest ingredients to ensure every bite is a
        delightful experience. Our mission at PupCake is to bring joy to both
        dog lovers and cupcake enthusiasts. We believe that every dog is
        special, and so are our cupcakes. From the playful Chihuahua Choco Chip
        to the sophisticated Poodle Perfection, our menu is designed to cater to
        a variety of tastes and preferences. We are committed to providing our
        customers with high-quality, freshly baked cupcakes that are as unique
        as the dogs that inspire them. Join us on this sweet journey and
        discover the perfect PupCake for every occasion. Thank you for choosing
        PupCakes, where every cupcake is a celebration of our four-legged
        friends.
